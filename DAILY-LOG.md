# Daily work log

## Day 00 — foundation (2026-10-26, Asia/Tehran)

- Prepared the product-specific Next.js/TypeScript workspace, responsive interface, light/dark theme, React Icons, PWA shell, README, AGENTS.md and 30-day backlog.
- Review: inspected the starter page, tests, database schema/config, build, Git ignore rules and local registry setup; corrected issues found by checks before recording a passing result.
- Dependencies: generated package-lock.json and installed packages after Nexus 404s. The user approved npmjs fallback. Local .npmrc remains ignored, preserves Nexus as default and maps only required scopes. No private registry config is tracked.
- Checks: npm test passed (1/1), npm run lint passed, npm run typecheck passed, and npm run build passed. The production build emitted the PWA manifest/service-worker shell.
- Database setup: npm run db:generate created a Drizzle/Turso migration. No remote database push was attempted.
- GitHub: Day 00 foundation commit 3e4cc0b is pushed to both main and day-00-foundation: https://github.com/danyallya/product-feedback. Day 01 has not started.
- Schedule: Day 01 has not started. The next task is Day 01 in BACKLOG.md; wait for the user to trigger that day.
